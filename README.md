# python-unittest-example
Example of Python unit test created as part of coursework.

This repository contains a sample of Python test script created as part of coursework in Software Quality Assurance and Deployment course.

The script uses Python's built-in 'unittest' framework to verify expected behavior, handle edge cases, and validate outcomes for a simple registration workflow.

This example is intended to demonstrate test case structure, assertions, and clear expected vs actual results rather than application complexity.
